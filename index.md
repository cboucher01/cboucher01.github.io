# Hello!

I am a web developer and UX designer based in the Philadelphia metro area. I currently work as an Educational and Scholarly Technology Assistant at Bryn Mawr College, where I provide support for information technology, digital scholarship, and the Makerspaces. I graduated from Bryn Mawr College with an A.B. in Russian and History, and I have a background in communications, film studies, and video editing.
