I am a web developer and educational technologist based in the Philadelphia area. I am currently pursuing an MSLIS at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign while working at Bryn Mawr College, where I support educational technology, digital scholarship, and the Makerspaces. I graduated from Bryn Mawr College with an A.B. in Russian and History, and I have a background in communications and film studies.
